To use isgnu, run the command 'chmod +x isgnu' from within this folder once
you've cloned it.

isgnu works internally by pinging one of two possible gnu project formats on the
gnu site: gnu_url/project_name or gnu_url/project_name.README. isgnu does not
cache, and isgnu does not have any options. Have fun!
